# PRSM
Persian Road Surface Marking (PRSM) Dataset: The dataset consists of over 6800 labeled images of Persian road surface markings in 18 popular classes. It also contains road surface markings under various daylight conditions such as sunny, sunset, and nighttime. Furthermore, this dataset contains images of marking signs in three different qualities, excellent, fair, and poor. The poor images have serious occlusion, motion blur, or are depreciated.
